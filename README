== Welcome to Bookmarkly

I've still got some work to do on this but I have completed most of the points including the generic search module.

== Still to do

I need to write some tests for the app, I want to do this well so I'm going to watch some rSpec tutorials first before
attempting them.

== Future Plans

I want to add a javascript bookmarklet that takes in the page url and adds a bookmark from in the browser on any page.
